# Example Data

This data set contains the genealogies of chromosome 22 for a set of 72 samples
from the Yoruba, British, and Pima populations from SGDP.

These three populations were extracted from a larger set using the
`RelateExtract` function, which is part of the
[Relate](https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/modules.html#Extract) package.

The data set includes the following files:

- `example.anc` and `example.mut`: These files contain ancestral and mutation
  data.
- `example.poplabels`: Poplabels file.
- `example.msp`: Predicted local ancestry for the Pima samples using
  [Gnomix](https://github.com/AI-sandbox/gnomix). The Pima samples exhibit low
  levels of recent admixture, with approximately 95% of their genome
  originating from Native American ancestries.
